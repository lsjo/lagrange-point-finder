Using a convergent algorithm to find the location of the Lagrange points

For this project I chose to investigate the location of Lagrange points, and rather than using equations to solve it, I created a convergent algorithm using Python, and visualised the results with Matplotlib. This was my first attempt at simulating physical processes with Python and is also a project I completed for a school assessment, which will be assessed against the Maths Talent Quest criteria.
